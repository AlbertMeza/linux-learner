# Linux Learner

The project is to create a Linux terminal. 

The user would see exactly what you see when you open up the terminal of UNIX.
The user would be able to type a limited amount of commands and should be get back exactly the same
responses you’d get on a real terminal. We will program a few Linux commands like ls and cd. 

We will incorporate one small hint in the bottom of the terminal of how the user can continue if 
they are stuck. 

There will be a small message at the bottom that says something like:
“(Command) -h for more information of what you can learn.”
