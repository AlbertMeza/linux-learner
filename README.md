# Linux Learner

The project is to create a Linux terminal. 

The user sees a replicated Linux shell.
The user will type commands and receive similar responses you would get on a real terminal.

We programed the following Linux commands: 

cd (Change Directory)

clear (Clear)

exit ( Exit from shell)

help (Used to understand commands)

ls (List)

pwd (Print Working Directory) 

touch (Used to create new files if non exist).

To guide the user, we incorporated three tasks (task1, task2, task3) to complete and an option to get directions for completing each task.
